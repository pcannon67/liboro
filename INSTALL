Then, for everyone:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> ../configure --prefix=[INSTALLATION PATH] --with-yarp=[PATH TO YARP INSTALLATION]
> make
> make install

Assuming a ontology server (started with oro_test.owl as test ontology for best results) and a YARP nameserver are both already running (and are accessible from your network), you can check everything is working with
> make regress
