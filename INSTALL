  Installation instruction for liboro
***************************************

Quick steps
-----------

If freshly checkouted, first do:

> autogen.sh

Then, for everyone:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> ../configure --prefix=[INSTALLATION PATH] --with-yarp=[PATH TO YARP INSTALLATION]
> make
> make install

Assuming a ontology server (started with oro_test.owl as test ontology for best results) and a YARP nameserver are both already running (and are accessible from your network), you can check everything is working with
> make regress


Generating oro_library.h
------------------------

You can automatically generate a "library" of classes and properties from the ontology you're working on with the generate_oro_library_from_ontology.py Python script.
The path to the ontology is curently hard-coded in the script (it could be easily improved... whatever...), so you may need to change it to match your setup.

To invoke it:
> python generate_oro_library_from_ontology.py > src/oro_library.h
