Assuming a ontology server (started with oro_bench.owl as ontology for best results) and a YARP nameserver are both already running (and are accessible from your network), you can check everything is working (and have a nice benchmark of your setup) with
> ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/oro-benchmark


Generating oro_library.h and oro_library.cpp
--------------------------------------------

You can automatically generate a "library" of classes and properties from the ontology you're working on with the generate_oro_library_from_ontology.py Python script.
The path to the ontology is curently hard-coded in the script (it could be easily improved... whatever...), so you may need to change it to match your setup.

To invoke it:
> chmod +x generate_oro_library_from_ontology.py
> ./generate_oro_library_from_ontology.py

The two files will be saved in ./src
It can be as well changed in the script.
